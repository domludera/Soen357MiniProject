# Data Byte
The following project was done in the realms of our User Interface Design course SOEN 357 under the supervision of Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel from Concordia University. The purpose of this project was to develop a website to host our results following a conducted case study about a Personal Data Marketplace which we called "Data Byte". The goal was to follow standard design procedures in order to develop a visual prototype for a software solution for a data marketplace.
Through data acquisition techniques (interviews), user personas, storyboards, journey maps, sketches and wireframes, we were able to arrive at a final visual prototype
